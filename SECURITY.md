## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

@oxog/sentinel is designed with security as a core principle:

1. **Zero Dependencies**: No external runtime dependencies reduces attack surface
2. **Secure Defaults**: All configurations default to secure settings
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
4. **Memory Safety**: Careful memory management to prevent exposure of sensitive data
5. **Access Control**: Built-in mechanisms to control access to monitoring data

### Data Protection

- **Heap Snapshots**: Automatically sanitized to remove sensitive data
- **Memory Dumps**: Optional encryption for stored memory analysis data
- **Logs**: Configurable log levels with sensitive data filtering
- **Reports**: Structured output with configurable data masking

### Runtime Security

- **Process Isolation**: Monitoring runs in isolated contexts where possible
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose system internals
- **Audit Trail**: Optional audit logging for compliance requirements

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using @oxog/sentinel in production:

1. **Configuration Security**
   ```javascript
   const sentinel = new Sentinel({
     // Use secure configurations
     reporting: {
       sanitizeData: true,
       maskSensitiveValues: true
     },
     access: {
       enableApiAuth: true,
       allowedOrigins: ['https://your-domain.com']
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Network Security**
   - Secure monitoring endpoints with authentication
   - Use HTTPS for all monitoring communications
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Monitor access logs for suspicious activity

3. **Data Security**
   - Enable data sanitization for heap snapshots
   - Configure sensitive data masking
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular security audits of monitoring data

4. **Environment Security**
   - Keep Node.js updated to latest LTS version
   - Use secure deployment practices
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring
   - Regular security scans of your application

### Configuration Examples

#### Secure Production Configuration

```javascript
const sentinel = new Sentinel({
  // Security settings
  security: {
    sanitizeHeapSnapshots: true,
    maskSensitiveData: true,
    enableAuditLogging: true,
    maxDataRetention: '7d'
  },
  
  // Access control
  access: {
    requireAuthentication: true,
    allowedIPs: ['10.0.0.0/8'],
    rateLimiting: {
      enabled: true,
      maxRequests: 100,
      windowMs: 900000 // 15 minutes
    }
  },
  
  // Reporting security
  reporting: {
    excludeSensitiveKeys: [
      'password', 'token', 'secret', 'key',
      'authorization', 'cookie', 'session'
    ],
    encryptReports: true,
    outputPath: '/secure/monitoring/'
  }
});
```

#### Docker Security Configuration

```dockerfile
# Use non-root user
USER node

# Secure file permissions
COPY --chown=node:node . .

# Security scanner
RUN npm audit --audit-level high

# Runtime security
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV SENTINEL_SECURE_MODE=true
```
